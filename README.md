# Effective properties of lattice-like structures

*Note: This is meant for [UTBM](https://www.utbm.fr/english/) students.*

This repository contains the material needed to perform the TD on the simulation for complex structures from CP55 UTBM course.

**Tasks:** 
1. Fill the jupyter notebook. This can be done online thanks, for instance, to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/thibaut-hirschler/UTBM-CP55-TDsimu1/blob/main/td1.ipynb) or [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/),
2. Perform a numerical homogenization of a lattice unit cell with Abaqus and the [Micromechanics plugin](https://kb.dsxclient.3ds.com/mashup-ui/page/resultqa?from=search%3fq%3dmicromechanics&id=QA00000046185e&q=micromechanics#).
